ALGORITHM - A vast Field
==========
Searching Algorithm
Algorithm is a solution or an implementation of a law or mathematical solution. It is related to many fields and has subfields too. This algorithm is a logical search to find answers accurately. We can use it, in large group of data for a logical reasoning. This file is all about, how to search an entry in an array? It directly deals with two things:

How to perform Linear search (arrange from minimal to maximum)
How to perform Binary search (It can be ordered forward or in a backward form)
